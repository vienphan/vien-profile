## 🧭 About Me  

I am a strategic leader and lifelong learner, currently shaping the transformation of **Nguyen Kim**, one of Vietnam’s largest consumer electronics retailers under **Central Retail Group**.  

Over the past 8 years, I’ve evolved from financial controller to strategy director — bridging **data, people, and vision**.  
I believe leadership today requires both **rational clarity and emotional intelligence** — where business growth and human growth move together.  

**Key beliefs:**  
- Strategy must be grounded in truth, guided by values.  
- Numbers tell stories — and stories give meaning to numbers.  
- Learning and self-reflection are the twin engines of leadership.
